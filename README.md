# SoT-Helper
A little companion program I made for the game Sea of Thieves for me and my friends to use

This program utilizes tkinter GUIs and Pandas to read information off an excel sheet. 
The program just displays helpful information while sailing in Sea of Thieves. 

source.py is the source code while SoT_Info.xlsx is where all the information comes from.
